# Mobile Application Recycle Me

## Background
Recycle Me App was introduced as an effort to reduce waste management issues by enhancing public understanding of the different types of waste, allowing for proper waste sorting. With this app, users can scan a waste and identify its type, enabling them to dispose of the waste  in the appropriate location. In addition to sorting waste, the process of recycling waste into useful items plays a crucial role in addressing waste issues. Therefore, the Recycle Me app introduces article recommendations on how to recycle waste based on its type, empowering users to recycle their generated waste into reusable items, thereby reducing unprocessed waste. Recycle Me seeks to engage the community in a meaningful way, encouraging them to contribute actively to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly waste management system.
